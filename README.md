# Project - Limitless Exporter

This began as a clone of the official Limitless [limitless-api-examples](https://github.com/limitless-ai-inc/limitless-api-examples) repository.

## üöÄ Getting Started

To get the Python scripts in this repository running, you'll first need to set up a virtual environment and install the necessary dependencies.

1.  **Navigate to the Python directory:**
    ```bash
    cd python
    ```

2.  **Create and activate a virtual environment:**
    It's recommended to create the virtual environment within the `python` directory.
    ```bash
    python3 -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate
    ```
    *(On Windows, the activation command is `venv\Scripts\activate`)*

3.  **Install requirements:**
    With the virtual environment activated and while still in the `python` directory:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

Once these steps are complete, you'll be ready to run the example scripts. Remember to activate your virtual environment (`source venv/bin/activate` from within the `python` directory) each time you start a new terminal session to work with these scripts.

## üõ≥Ô∏è Python Script Examples

All commands below assume you are in the `python/` directory with your virtual environment activated and `.env` file configured.

### 1. Exporting Daily Lifelogs (Raw Markdown)

The `export_day_lifelogs.py` script fetches all lifelog entries for a specific date, handles API pagination and retries, and saves the concatenated raw markdown to `exports/lifelogs/YYYY-MM-DD-lifelogs.md`.

**Usage:**
```bash
python export_day_lifelogs.py YYYY-MM-DD
```
**Example:**
```bash
python export_day_lifelogs.py 2025-02-28
```

### 2. Generating Daily Summaries

The `summarize_day.py` script takes a previously exported daily lifelog markdown file and uses OpenAI (GPT-4.1-Nano by default) to generate a factual, journal-style summary. The summary is saved to `exports/summaries/YYYY-MM-DD-summary.md`.

**Usage:**
```bash
python summarize_day.py path/to/your/YYYY-MM-DD-lifelogs.md
```
**Example (after running export_day_lifelogs.py):**
```bash
python summarize_day.py ../exports/lifelogs/2025-02-28-lifelogs.md
```

### 3. Exporting Daily Lifelogs (Structured JSON)

The `export_day_contents_json.py` script fetches all lifelog entries for a specific date, including their full markdown and the structured `contents` array (which contains individual text segments, timestamps, speaker info, etc.). This is saved to `exports/contents/YYYY-MM-DD-contents.json`. This JSON format is ideal for detailed programmatic analysis.

**Usage:**
```bash
python export_day_contents_json.py YYYY-MM-DD
```
**Example:**
```bash
python export_day_contents_json.py 2025-02-28
```

### 4. Batch Processing: Daily Exports & Summaries

The `batch_process_days.py` script automates the process of exporting daily lifelogs (using `export_day_lifelogs.py`) and then generating summaries (using `summarize_day.py`) for a specified range of dates. It includes robust retry mechanisms for each step and for each day.

**Usage:**
```bash
python batch_process_days.py START_DATE END_DATE [OPTIONS]
# Or run without dates to process missing days up to yesterday:
python batch_process_days.py [OPTIONS]
```
**Example (process January 2025):**
```bash
python batch_process_days.py 2025-01-01 2025-01-31
```
Use `--help` to see available options for retry behavior and export parameters.

### 5. Batch Processing: Daily Structured JSON Exports

The `batch_export_contents_json.py` script automates the export of structured JSON data (using `export_day_contents_json.py`) for a specified range of dates. This is useful for backfilling the `exports/contents/` directory needed for usage analytics.

**Usage:**
```bash
python batch_export_contents_json.py START_DATE END_DATE [OPTIONS]
# Or run without dates to process missing days up to yesterday:
python batch_export_contents_json.py [OPTIONS]
```
**Example (export contents for February 2025):**
```bash
python batch_export_contents_json.py 2025-02-01 2025-02-28
```
Use `--help` to see available options.

### 6. Analyzing Daily Usage & Generating Reports

The `analyze_daily_usage.py` script processes the structured JSON data from `exports/contents/` for a given date or date range. For each day, it:
-   Prints detailed usage statistics to the console.
-   Generates and saves a visual timeline chart of recording sessions to `exports/analytics/YYYY-MM-DD-usage-timeline.png`.
-   Creates a comprehensive markdown report (`exports/analytics/YYYY-MM-DD-analytics.md`) containing all statistics and embedding the timeline chart.

**Prerequisite:** Ensure the corresponding `YYYY-MM-DD-contents.json` files exist in `exports/contents/` for the dates you want to analyze.

**Usage (single day):**
```bash
python analyze_daily_usage.py YYYY-MM-DD
```
**Usage (date range):**
```bash
python analyze_daily_usage.py START_DATE END_DATE
```
**Usage (automatic date range - recommended for daily catch-up):**
```bash
python analyze_daily_usage.py
```
If run without date arguments, `analyze_daily_usage.py` will automatically determine the range of days to process. It will start from the day after the last generated analytics report (or the earliest available content if no reports exist) and process up to yesterday or the latest available content data, whichever is earlier.

**Example:**
```bash
python analyze_daily_usage.py 2025-02-28
# or for a range
python analyze_daily_usage.py 2025-03-01 2025-03-10
```
